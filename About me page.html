			I am genuinely winging this and hoping it all works out, (in this class and my life)
		</p>
		<p>
			Please don't judge my basic and bland website
		<p>
			Currently, my favorite song is Enemy by Beartooth, german chocolate is the best, in my opinion.
			I enjoy woodcarving, though I'm not particularly skilled, but I think it's fun.
			I have a dog that is a mix of a poodle and a schnauzer. I tend to whistle absentmindedly.
			I do not have a mean bone in my body. I do however, have several sarcastic bones and a dry sense of humor.
			Other than that, fairly boring
