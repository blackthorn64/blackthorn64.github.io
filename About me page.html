			I am genuinely winging this and hoping it all works out, (in this class and my life)
		</p>
		<p>
			Please don't judge my basic and bland website
		<p>
			Currently, my favorite song is Enemy by Beartooth. <img src="beartooth.jpg" height="100" width="120">

		<p>My favorite type of cake is german chocolate.
			I enjoy woodcarving. I'm not particularly skilled, but I think it's fun.
			I have a dog that is a mix of a poodle and a schnauzer. I tend to whistle absentmindedly.
			I do not have a mean bone in my body. I do however, have several sarcastic bones and a dry sense of humor.
			Other than that,  I am fairly boring.

		 My favorite animal is a crow. <img src="crow-in-field.jpg" height="60" width="80">
